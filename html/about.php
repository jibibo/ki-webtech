      <h1>About us</h1>
      <h5>How it started</h5>
      <p>UvAzon (not related to Amazon.com, Inc. in any form), is a small
        startup company based in the Netherlands. Created by four enthousiastic
        students (FOTO'S!) their aim is to provide any other student with all
        the supplies they need during their stay on the University of Amsterdan
        and Science Park.</p>

        <h1 class="header_title">OUR STORY</h1>
        <p> We founded Uvazon at the heart of innovation and science, namely at Science Park Amsterdam.</p>
        <p> Our main goal was to provide services for students to make their lives more flexible and easy.</p>
        <p> Since we are students ourselves, we could understand a student's needs as no other.</p>
        <p> Therefore we could no longer standby and we took immediately matters into our own hands.</p>
        <p> After months of hard work and sleepless nights, we now present to you the solution of our future: Uvazon.</p>
