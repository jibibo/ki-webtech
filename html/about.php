      <h1 class="header_title">OUR STORY</h1>
      <p> We founded Uvazon at the heart of innovation and science, namely at Science Park Amsterdam.</p>
      <p> Our main goal was to provide services for students to make their lives more flexible and easy.</p>
      <p> Since we are students ourselves, we could understand a student's needs as no other.</p>
      <p> Therefore we could no longer standby and we took immediately matters into our own hands.</p>
      <p> After months of hard work and sleepless nights, we now present to you the solution of our future: Uvazon.</p>
